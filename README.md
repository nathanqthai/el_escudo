The EL Escudo Sequencer is a board that contains an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, 
and circuitry for controlling up to eight strands of electroluminescent wire. This code
provides a framwork for users who want to write code in C++ and upload to the board 
without using the Arduino IDE.

However, the board must have an Arduino Bootloader on it.
